# üöÄ RISC-V Simulator
A multi-core RISC-V processor simulator capable of simulating multiple cores with shared memory, pipelining, cache hierarchies, and specialized memory systems.

## üìã Project Overview
This simulator was developed as part of the CS209P Computer Architecture course project, completed in three phases:

### Phase 1: Multi-Core Base Implementation ‚öôÔ∏è

* Four independent RISC-V processor cores with shared memory access
* Support for core-specific instruction sets including ADD/SUB, BNE, JAL, LW/SW
* Each core has access to dedicated memory regions within a shared 4kB memory space
* Core identification through special purpose read-only registers

### Phase 2: Pipelining and Shared Execution üîÑ

* Implementation of pipelining with data forwarding capability (can be toggled)
* Single fetch unit shared across all compute units, with separate decode/execute/memory/writeback stages
* Variable instruction latencies configurable by users
* Conditional execution based on core ID (CID)
* Performance metrics including stall counts and IPC (Instructions Per Cycle)

### Phase 3: Memory Hierarchy and Synchronization üß†

* Complete memory hierarchy with L1 instruction cache, L1 data cache, and unified L2 cache
* Configurable cache parameters (size, block size, associativity, access latency)
* Multiple cache replacement policies (LRU and another chosen policy)
* Scratchpad memory (SPM) implementation with specialized instructions
* SYNC instruction for core synchronization
* Comprehensive performance metrics (stalls, cache miss rates, IPC)
